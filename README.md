This project contains different kind of deadlock code scenario that developer will encounter when writing concurrency code in Golang.

Each folder are structured as follows:

* `problemX` - each folder contains README.md that explain about the concurrency problem and solution
* `problematic` - folder contains the deadlock error code
* `solution` - folder contains the proper solution to resolve the issue. Sometimes it contains multiple solution for a problem

The concurrency problem collected in this repo are from different variety of source from the internet - user groups, slack channel, github, etc

Here are some very good resource to learn more about concurrency in Golang:
